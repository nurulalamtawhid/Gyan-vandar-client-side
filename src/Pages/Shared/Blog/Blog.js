                        <p className="px-4 py-6 pt-0 ml-4 -mt-4 text-gray-600">Facebook released React.js in March 2013 as a JavaScript library.React.js uses a virtual DOM that only compares the previous HTML code differences and only loads the different parts which  impacts the loading times.AngularJS was developed in 2009 by Google.Angular.js is an MVC framework. A major disadvantage of Angular is that it uses a regular DOM, which massively impacts the loading time. Vuejs was developed by ex-Google employee Evan You in 2014.Vue.js core library focuses on the View layer only. Itâ€™s called a progressive framework because you can extend its functionality with official and third-party packages, such as Vue Router or Vuex, to turn it into an actual framework</p>
